# Poisson solver based on Neko on FPGA
This repository contains the code we used for our paper "A High-Fidelity Flow Solver for Unstructured Meshes 
on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays: Design, Evaluation, and Future Challenges" presented at HPC Asia 2022.

## Code information
To run the code a working installation of Neko is required. The code is purely experimental.

All FPGA designs that we considered are stored in different subdirectories, overall we tried out close to 100 different versions (not all were synthesized though).
For the article we in the end used the versions specified in the run scripts.
